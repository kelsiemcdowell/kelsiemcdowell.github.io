		<h3>Our Story</h3>

		<p> 
			Jessie and Grant met in August 2012. It was a beautiful summer day in San Diego and they each had decided to go to the horse races in Del Mar. It was this big event and the luck of having a couple mutual friends that brought these two to the same place that day. It was love at first sight! Jessie became Grant's lucky charm as she gave him advice she had gotten from her Mom to picking a winning horse. From the moment they laid eyes on each other and as the days, weeks and months progressed, they knew this was going to be something special. That day at the races was the start of a beautiful love they have shared now for 4+ years and they can't wait to celebrate their marriage with you all this September!
